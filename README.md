ionFlicker | Hybrid Mobile Prototype 📱

A cross-platform mobile application prototype developed with Ionic Framework and Angular. This project was created to explore the feasibility of porting native logic to hybrid environments while maintaining a high-quality user experience.

🚀 Technical Stack

Framework: Ionic Framework (UI Components & Native APIs).

Core: Angular (Architecture & Logic).

Language: TypeScript.

Asynchronous Logic: RxJS for reactive programming and stream management.

Styling: SASS / CSS3 for custom UI components.

🏗️ Architecture & Approach

The app follows the standard Angular Modular Architecture, focusing on:

Service-Oriented Design: Data handling and API interactions are encapsulated in reusable services.

Observable Streams: Using RxJS Observables to manage asynchronous data flows from external APIs, ensuring a reactive and non-blocking interface.

Cross-Platform Consistency: Implementing Ionic's adaptive styling to ensure the app looks and feels native on both Android and iOS.

🛠️ Key Learning Outcomes

Hybrid Development: Mastering the bridge between web technologies and native mobile hardware.

API Integration: Consuming RESTful services and managing complex JSON responses.

Performance Optimization: Implementing lazy loading for modules to improve initial boot time and app responsiveness.
